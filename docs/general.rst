ECOMOD modeling support system.
---------
A modeling support program for socio-economic processes. The system derives the necessary optimality conditions for complex economic models, in which agents plan their decisions based on optimal management tasks. We will introduce you to the input and output of the model formulation, the description of the optimal management tasks of agents and coordination of their solutions through interactions, the technological aspects of working with mathematical model formulations.

--------
Let us describe the logic of the agent problem construction as follows:
--------
- Selection of the decision-making party, control and external parameters
- Formulation of optimality conditions for the choice of agent control
- Simplification of the set of optimality conditions
- Combining different agent models through interaction models
- Numerical and scenario analysis of problem solution, forming a set of all conditions

The system we create is an end-to-end LaTeX handler for agent-based models created in the Pyton language.
